Install [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html)

## Issues
This has only been tested on macOS. I am not sure how this will behave on Windows. The code is designed to handle different screen sizes and layouts, but only trying it can truly tell.

The layout of the search result is taken from the wiki, for better or worse.
